# Markovian-Spatiotemporal-Propagation
Novel approach to performing online learning for multivariate spatiotemporal models. We aim to build a Markovian dependence structure between the incoming datasets at each time instant. In doing so, we exploit the suitable matrix formulation obtainable for dynamic linear models.
