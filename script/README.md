# Execution Scripts for Reproducibility 

The R script collected in this folder allows the entire reproduction of all the numbers and figures shown in "_Adaptive Markovian Spatiotemporal Transfer Learning in Multivariate Bayesian Modeling_". Here, a brief reminder of which script is needed to reproduce the contents of a specific Section is presented to ease the reproducibility. Reminding the Workflow on the main `README.md` of this repository, for an exhaustive and detailed approach to reproduce the results.
